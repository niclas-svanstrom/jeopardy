## Jeopardy! App for New Year's Game Night

### As the game master for our New Year's celebration, I decided to bring a classic favorite to the table â€“ Jeopardy! However, being a programmer, I couldn't settle for the traditional cardboard and post-it notes setup. Instead, I created a PyQt5 app to elevate the experience.

### The game involves four teams, each assigned a key on the keyboard. When the timer runs out for a question, the first person to press their team's key gets the chance to answer. But there's a twist â€“ if someone tries to buzz in before the time is up, they face a 0.5-second delay before being able to press their key again.

### This app adds a tech-savvy touch to our trivia night, and it only took me around 2-3 hours to put together. Let the Jeopardy fun begin! ðŸŽ‰
